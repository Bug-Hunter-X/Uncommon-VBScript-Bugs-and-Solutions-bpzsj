Addressing Late Binding:
Always use early binding whenever possible. Declare object variables with their specific type using the `Set` statement and the correct class name. This allows the compiler to catch type-related errors during development.

Example:
```vbscript
Dim obj As Object
Set obj = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
```

Handling Implicit Type Conversion:  Explicitly convert variables to the expected type before performing operations or comparisons. Use functions like `CInt`, `CStr`, `CDbl` to ensure data type consistency and avoid unexpected behavior.

Example:
```vbscript
if CInt("10") = 10 then 'Explicit Conversion
  msgbox "Equal!"
end if
```

Improving Error Handling: Avoid using `On Error Resume Next` unless absolutely necessary. Instead, implement structured error handling with `On Error GoTo`, where you can trap errors, log them appropriately, and take corrective actions.  This prevents the program from proceeding with corrupted data or an undefined state.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
' ... Your code...
Exit Sub
ErrorHandler:
  msgbox "Error Number: " & Err.Number & ", Description: " & Err.Description
end sub
```
By implementing these solutions, VBScript developers can create more robust and reliable applications, reducing the occurrence of unexpected errors and improving overall code quality.
